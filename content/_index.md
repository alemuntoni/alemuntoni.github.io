# Alessandro Muntoni

I am a Research Fellow of the [Visual Computing Lab](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/) of [ISTI-CNR](http://www.isti.cnr.it/) in Pisa.

My research is focused on Computer Graphics, mainly on Digital Fabrication and Geometry Processing. I am currently mantaining softwares developed in the VCLab, the main ones are [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/) and [PyMeshLab](https://pymeshlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Before joining the VCLab, I was part of the [CG3HCI](http://sites.unica.it/cg3hci/) group of the University of Cagliari, where I earned my BSc, MSc and Ph.D.
