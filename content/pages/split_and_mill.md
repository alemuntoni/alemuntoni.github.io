## Abstract

We present here Split and Mill: an interactive system for the manual volume decomposition of free form shapes.
Our primary purpose is to generate portions respecting the properties allowing to mill them with a 3-axis milling machine.
We show that a manual decomposition is competitive with the automatic partitioning when the user is skilled enough.
We, thus, think that our tool can be beneficial for the practitioners in the field, and we release it as free software.
